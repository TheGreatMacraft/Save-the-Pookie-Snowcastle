The game is structured into waves. Each wave consists of random amount of different enemies, that provide a fair challenge for the players at all stages of progression.

In between stages, players have a certain amount of time to purchase new defense artillery, weapons, pets, etc.
## Enemies
1. **Bad snowman** - This creature will throw snowballs at the castle.
2. **Gnomes** - They will attack the players and attempt to disable traps. They will not attack the main castle until there is something else they can do.
3. **Snow golem** - Massive creature, that moves slowly, but deals a lot of damage when it gets a hit on it.
4. **Gingerbread man** - Fast and deals minimal damage to the castle. If it senses players nearby, it'll throw itself face first into snow, to camouflage.
### Boss Enemies
1. **Papa Gnome** - Bigger, slower enemy.
## Buildings
### Defenses
1. **Snow cannon** - can be mounted by a player and used to shoot snowballs. When upgraded, it fires automatically at closest enemy, it can reach.
### Assistance
1. **Radar** - Provides a mini-map until disabled or destroyed
## Weapons
1. **Hand** - Players can always throw snowballs with hands.
2. **Shotgun**
3. **Rifle**
4. **Shovel** - If players run out of snowballs mid fight, they can shovel the ground to get some.
## Pets
1. **White Fox** - moves quickly towards the toughest enemy and alters the players of its presence
2. **Polar Bear** - moves slowly towards the closes enemy it can catch and attacks them
3. **Black Kitty** - scares the monsters away, prolonging their destruction
# Artstyle
